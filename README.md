<h1>My Ice Cream Project</h1>

This ice cream ordering application allows users to browse through various ice cream options, select the type of ice cream they want (cup or cone), and add it to their cart. It has user-friendly features such as instant cart updates and dynamic changes in the total price.
React-Redux is preferred for state management, allowing users to instantly update their cart actions.
The application allows users to increase, decrease, or completely remove ice creams from their cart. During these actions, the total price and number of products in the cart are automatically updated. The cart status is managed with Redux, and performance is optimized thanks to the powerful state management features of @reduxjs/toolkit.
We ensured that the application is user-friendly and navigable with React-Router-Dom. A responsive and modern interface was designed with TailwindCSS. The structure, which adapts to different screen sizes, allows users to have a comfortable shopping experience on mobile and desktop devices.
Tests were written with @testing-library to ensure the reliability of the application. Test tools provided with Jest-DOM ensure that the components work correctly and user interactions result as expected.
